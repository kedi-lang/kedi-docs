# Codex

## Codex App Server

The Codex adapter starts:

```text
codex app-server --stdio
```

It communicates directly over App Server JSON-RPC. The default thread is
ephemeral, so ordinary Kedi calls do not become persistent Codex threads.

## Authentication

Install the Codex CLI, ensure `codex` is on `PATH`, and authenticate it before
running Kedi. The App Server uses the CLI's existing authentication and
configuration; Kedi does not accept or persist Codex credentials.

## Model and Reasoning Settings

```kedi
> agent: codex
> model: gpt-5
> effort: high
```

Supported settings are `approval_policy`, `config`, `cwd`, `model_provider`,
`personality`, `sandbox`, `service_tier`, `summary`, and `timeout`.

## Working Directory

`cwd` defaults to the Kedi process working directory:

```kedi
> settings:
    cwd: /workspace/project
```

The directory governs Codex built-in filesystem and shell behavior.

## Sandbox Policy

Kedi defaults Codex to `workspace-write`. Accepted aliases normalize to Codex
App Server sandbox values. Use `read-only` for analysis-only tasks or a broader
mode only when the environment and approval policy justify it.

## Approval Policy

Kedi leaves the App Server in approval-requesting mode by default and resolves
native shell/file approval methods through Kedi policy. A static/dynamic Kedi
policy also guards projected dynamic tools.

App Server native approvals cannot apply Kedi's edited arguments. An `edit`
decision for such a native request is declined rather than silently treated as
allow.

## Built-In Tools

Codex retains its harness-native shell and filesystem tools. Kedi procedures
and Python tools become App Server dynamic tools for the active run.

Kedi MCP declarations are currently unsupported by `CodexAdapter` and raise;
this does not mean the Codex installation itself has no MCP configuration.

## Structured Output

Kedi passes JSON Schema through `turn/start.outputSchema`, parses the returned
JSON, and validates Pydantic models. Object schemas are closed with
`additionalProperties: false`.

Supported string formats are `date`, `date-time`, `duration`, `email`, and
`time`. Other JSON Schema string formats fail before the turn; use a plain or
`Annotated` string when semantic guidance is sufficient.

## Subagent Lifecycle

Codex supports foreground/background children. Dynamic tools, sandbox, cwd,
model, instructions, and approval ceilings are rebuilt per child scope.

## Capability Limits

- Kedi MCP server declarations are unsupported.
- Native approval handlers support allow/deny, not argument editing.
- The `codex` executable and compatible App Server are required.
