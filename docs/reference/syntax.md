# Syntax Index

## Program Forms

| Form | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `@name(params) -> Type:` | Define a lexically scoped procedure |
| `~Name(fields)` | Define a Pydantic-compatible custom type |
| `[name: Type] = value` | Deterministic assignment |
| `>> prompt [field: Type]` | Structured model call |
| `[name] << prompt` | Raw text model call and capture |
| `>> prompt` with no fields | Raw model call whose response is discarded |
| `= value` | Return text assembled from literals and substitutions |
| `= `expression`` | Return one native Python value |
| `= ```...```` | Execute Python statements and return their value |
| `` `statement` `` | Execute one Python statement for side effects |
| `````...````` | Execute a multiline Python block |
| `> name: ...` | Apply a directive |
| `# ...` / `### ... ###` | Line or block comment |

Declarations and executable statements retain source order. Indentation defines
scope; tabs compare as width four, but spaces are recommended.

## Templates and Values

| Syntax | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `<name>` | Read and render a variable |
| `<procedure(args)>` | Call a procedure and render its result |
| `<`expression`>` | Evaluate Python and render the result |
| `[field]` | Capture a model-produced string |
| `[field: Type]` | Capture and validate a typed model output |
| `[field: `TypeExpr`]` | Resolve the output type from Python |

Angle brackets are reads; square brackets are writes. Substitution always
renders into surrounding text. A Python assignment or native return preserves
the object.

Adjacent continuation lines after one `>>` are newline-joined into one model
call. Outputs become visible after the whole block completes. A new `>>` starts
a new call and may read outputs from a previous call.

## Procedures

```kedi
@format_issue(
  issue_id: int,
  title: str = `"Untitled"`
) -> str:
  = Issue \#<issue_id>: <title>
```

Parameters support positional and named calls, Python-expression defaults, and
direct or backtick type annotations. Required parameters precede defaults.
Unannotated parameters and returns default to `str`.

Calls may nest:

```kedi
= `format_issue(issue.id, title=issue.title)`
```

Commas, parentheses, and delimiters that are literal Kedi text must be escaped
when they would otherwise be parsed as call syntax.

## Custom Types

```kedi
~Finding(
  path: Annotated[str, "Repository-relative path"],
  severity: Literal["low", "high"],
  tags: list[str] = `[]`
)
```

Field names are unique identifiers. Required fields precede defaults, and a
defaulted field needs an explicit type. Mutable defaults are deep-copied per
instance.

## Python Forms

- Backticks inside an assignment, return, argument, substitution, annotation,
  model, setting, or directive are Python expressions.
- A standalone backtick line is a Python statement.
- Triple-backtick blocks contain Python statements. Add `=` before the opening
  fence when the block should return a value.
- The initial top-level Python fence is the prelude and supplies globals to
  following Kedi declarations.

Kedi values are available as Python globals in the runtime frame. Python writes
to recognized Kedi globals are synchronized; lexical locals remain scoped.

## Validation and Generation

```kedi
@test: procedure_name:
  > case: unique_case:
    `assert procedure_name() == "ok"`

@eval: procedure_name:
  > data: rows:
    = `[(input_value, {"field": "expected"})]`
  > test_data: rows:
    = `[(held_out_value, {"field": "expected"})]`
  > metric: score(rows):
    = `procedure_name(rows) == expected["field"]`
```

`> optimize:` and `> auto:` occur inside procedures. Their bodies accept either
an explicit leading `>>` or legacy bare template lines. Bare template lines are
invalid everywhere else.

## Escapes

| Escape | Literal result |
| --- | --- |
| `\<` `\>` | angle brackets |
| `\[` `\]` | square brackets |
| `\(` `\)` | parentheses |
| `\,` | comma |
| `\=` `\@` `\#` | equals, at, hash |
| `\~` or `~~` | tilde |
| ``\` `` | backtick |
| `\\` | backslash |
| `\t` `\n` `\s` | tab, newline, preserved space |

A trailing backslash continues a rendered `=` return onto the next physical
line. It is unrelated to template continuation.

## Names and Comments

Identifiers match Python-style names: a letter or underscore followed by
letters, digits, or underscores. `args` is runtime-owned and cannot be assigned.
`#` begins a Kedi comment; use `\#` for a visible hash. A first `###` block in a
procedure or profile becomes its docstring.
