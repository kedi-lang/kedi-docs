# Language Server

## Start `kedi-lsp`

```bash
kedi-lsp
```

Equivalent fallback:

```bash
python -m kedi.lsp.server
```

The server uses stdio and is normally started by an editor extension.

Running it in a terminal waits for LSP protocol messages; it is not an
interactive Kedi prompt. Use `kedi --idle` for that. The selected Python
environment must have Kedi installed, independently of the editor extension.

## Parsing and Diagnostics

Documents are reparsed on open/change; diagnostics clear on close. Reports
cover grammar, duplicate declarations/import entries, unresolved imports,
invalid profile graphs/settings/types, and semantic directive errors.

## Type Diagnostics

The LSP resolves built-in, custom, imported, nested, generic, union, and
`Annotated` type expressions. It reports invalid type positions and schema
formats that the selected adapter cannot carry.

## Adapter Capability Diagnostics

Selection state is tracked lexically. Unsupported structured output is an
error. Unsupported tool/MCP/profile capabilities are reported at the relevant
directive. Diagnostics use adapter metadata, not a hard-coded backend guess.
An active `> history:` processor declaration, including an external callable,
receives a non-blocking prefix-cache warning at its declaration. Adding
`processor_condition` does not remove that warning. A statically disabled
``processor: `None` `` does not warn, and the warning is not repeated at every
model call. The LSP also completes and explains `processor_condition`.

## Completion

Completion covers directives, procedures, values, types, profiles, imports,
settings, tools, and scoped names. Suggestions respect source position and
imported module surfaces.

Directive suggestions describe their purpose and preserve the leading `>` when
accepted. They appear while entering a directive name, not in its value after
`:`. The colon does not trigger a completion popup, so Enter can start the next
line. Backtick delimiters do not trigger Kedi suggestions or insert a matching
backtick automatically; Python completion remains available inside expressions.

## Hover Documentation

Hover shows procedure/type/profile signatures, fields, docstrings, variables,
directives, and imported symbols. Procedure/profile leading block comments are
surfaced as documentation.

## Definition and References

Go-to-definition and references work across declarations, calls,
substitutions, types, profiles, and module imports. Rename is available for
supported Kedi symbols and produces a workspace edit.

## Module Surfaces

The server reads exported sibling/bundled/installed modules, honors selective
imports and `> export: *`, and does not expose private non-exported names.

## Python Virtual Documents

Embedded Python fences/backticks are transformed into scope-aware virtual
Python documents with Kedi procedures, values, and types represented as Python.
Editor proxies use these maps for Python completion, hover, definition, and
references. Completion snippets and additional edits are mapped back to source;
auto-imports are inserted in the module's Python prelude, creating one when
needed. Synthetic declarations are not writable. An unmappable required edit
rejects the suggestion instead of silently omitting its import.

VS Code uses Python/Pylance and requests up to 128 resolved suggestions at a
time. Zed uses Pyright with lazy completion resolution. Both discard stale
results after a document change. These features require matching current editor
and Kedi language-server revisions.

Python files with query docstrings whose first cleaned line is `kedi` receive
Kedi diagnostics, hover, definition, references, and semantic tokens inside
the docstring.

The server also provides semantic tokens, document symbols, formatting,
signature help on `(` and `,`, and inlay hints.

## What Diagnostics Do Not Prove

Editor validation is not execution. A clean document does not prove a provider
is authenticated, tools are available, a model claim is true, or a program's
side effects are safe. Use deterministic tests and model-backed evals for their
respective contracts. Python virtual documents are an analysis projection,
not a second copy of the running program or a sandbox.
